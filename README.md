# Solution to Recurrence relation of different Hierarchical matrices in 2D and 3D
choice -> dictates the hierarchical structure
## Error bound for matrix-vector product due to different hierarchical matrices

## Storage/Computational complexity of different hierarchical matrices

We use MATLAB Symbolic solution to solve the recurrence equations.
